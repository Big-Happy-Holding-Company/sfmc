## Task System

### Task Structure

Tasks are defined in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "OS-001",
  "title": "Oxygen Sensor Calibration",
  "description": "Task description for context",
  "category": "üõ°Ô∏è O‚ÇÇ Sensor Check",
  "difficulty": "Basic",
  "gridSize": 2,
  "timeLimit": null,
  "basePoints": 3,
  "requiredRankLevel": 1,
  "emojiSet": "status_main",
  "examples": [{"input": [[0,1],[1,0]], "output": [[1,0],[0,1]]}],
  "testInput": [[0,1],[1,0]],
  "testOutput": [[1,0],[0,1]],
  "hints": ["Hint 1", "Hint 2", "Solution"]
}
```

### Emoji Sets

Tasks use emoji sets to represent different game elements. The mapping from numbers to emojis is handled automatically by the frontend.

## Officer Track (In Development)

### Current Goal
Simple puzzle lookup system where users can:
- Input exact puzzle ID (e.g., `1ae2feb7` from `data/evaluation2/1ae2feb7.json`)
- View random puzzles by their IDs

### Data Sources
Raw ARC-AGI datasets in local directories:
- `data/training/` - ARC training puzzles  
- `data/evaluation/` - ARC evaluation puzzles
- `data/training2/` - Extended training set
- `data/evaluation2/` - Extended evaluation set

### Next Steps
1. Investigate what data is actually in PlayFab Title Data
2. Build simple puzzle ID input/lookup interface
3. Display puzzles by their unique IDs

## Development


## Gameplay

### Rank Progression

Players advance through Space Force enlisted ranks by earning points from solving puzzles. Each rank requires more points to achieve than the previous one.

### Task Categories

- **üõ°Ô∏è O‚ÇÇ Sensor Check**: Oxygen system diagnostics
- **üöÄ Pre-Launch Ops**: Launch preparation tasks
- **üìä Fuel Systems**: Fuel flow and mixture analysis
- **üß≠ Navigation**: Directional calibration
- **üì° Communications**: Communication systems
- **‚ö° Power Systems**: Power distribution
- **üîí Security**: Security systems

## Development

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables: Copy `.env` and add `VITE_PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID`
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`

### Documentation

üìö **See [docs/](./docs/)** for comprehensive documentation:
- **[PlayFab API Analysis](./docs/playfab-api-analysis.md)** - Complete API reference and security audit
- **[Migration Plan](./docs/2SeptPlayfabTasks.md)** - PlayFab implementation phases

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice**: Current task validation is client-side only. See API Analysis for production security recommendations.

### Adding New Tasks

Tasks are now managed in **PlayFab Title Data**. To add new tasks:

1. Use the PlayFab dashboard to update Title Data
2. Follow the task structure shown above
3. Use numbers 0-9 in input/output arrays (emojis are mapped in the UI)
4. Tasks are loaded automatically on app refresh
5. No server restart required - it's a static site!

### Deployment

```bash
# Build static site
npm run build

# Preview production build locally  
npm start
```

Static files are deployed to Railway and served from CDN.

## Narrative Story Wrapper System  //  BEING REMOVED WITH PLAYFAB!

### Purpose
Adds a light-hearted Space-Force-2050 story layer to mundane training tasks without touching core puzzle data.

### How It Works
1. `server/data/problems.json` ‚Äì Holds every narrative template.  Keys are transformation types; each array contains one template per task **category** (O‚ÇÇ Sensor Check, Pre-Launch Ops, Fuel Systems, Navigation, Communications, Power Systems, Security).
2. `server/data/antagonists.json` ‚Äì List of mischievous characters (e.g. "Rick the Intern") that caused the mishap.
3. `server/data/components.json` ‚Äì List of ship components the antagonist fiddled with.
4. `server/templates/storyTemplates.ts` ‚Äì Loader that reads `problems.json` at runtime and exposes templates to the factory.
5. `server/tools/story-factory.ts` ‚Äì Pure function that:
   - Randomly selects an antagonist + component.
   - Picks the correct template for the task‚Äôs `transformationType` + `category`.
   - Substitutes `{{antagonist}}` and `{{component}}` placeholders.
   - Returns an enriched task object ready for the API/UI.

### Updating Stories (Writers-Friendly)
- Open `server/data/problems.json`.
- Find the transformation type you want (e.g. `rotation_90deg`).
- Add or edit an object in the array with fields: `id`, `category`, `title`, `description`.
- Keep it short (<60-char title, <180-char description) and include placeholders where relevant.
- No code changes are needed ‚Äì the loader will pick it up automatically.

## AI Failure Content System

### Purpose
Provides humorous and educational content about why AI struggles with different transformation types, adding both entertainment value and educational insights to tasks.

### AI Failure Data Structure
The `server/data/ai_failure.json` file contains content for each transformation type:

```json
{
  "transformation_type": {
    "ai_difficulty": "Technical explanation of why AI struggles with this transformation",
    "comic_situation1": "Humorous scenario showing AI failing at the transformation",
    "comic_situation2": "Another humorous scenario",
    "comic_situation3": "A third humorous scenario",
    "kids_explanation": "Simple explanation for younger players about why the transformation is hard for AI",
    "kids_explanation1": "Second simple explanation",
    "kids_explanation2": "Third simple explanation"
  }
}
```

### Transformation Types Covered
- `horizontal_reflection`: Mirror flips left-to-right
- `vertical_reflection`: Mirror flips top-to-bottom
- `rotation_90deg`: 90¬∞ clockwise rotation
- `rotation_270deg`: 270¬∞ clockwise (or 90¬∞ counter-clockwise) rotation
- `pattern_completion`: Logical sequence pattern completion

### Using the AI Failure Content
- Use the `scripts/enhance-tasks.js` script to automatically enhance task descriptions and hints with this content
- The enhancement script:
  1. Detects the transformation type used in each task
  2. Prepends a random comic situation and AI difficulty explanation to the task's description
  3. Adds the three kids_explanation entries to the beginning of the hints array
- For tasks that don't follow standard transformation naming patterns, manual enhancement is recommended

### Updating AI Failure Content
- Edit `server/data/ai_failure.json` to modify existing content
- Maintain the structure of each transformation type entry
- When adding new transformation types, ensure all seven fields are included
- After updating, re-run the enhancement script to apply changes to task files

---

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability Considerations
- Database migration from in-memory to persistent storage

### Feature Roadmap
- Unity port
- UI/UX improvements
- Officer track with complex transformations
- Onboarding system
