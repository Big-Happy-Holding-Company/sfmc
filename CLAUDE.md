# CLAUDE.md - Space Force Mission Control 2050

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

**Project Status as of September 4, 2025**: Production-ready ARC-AGI puzzle platform with pure PlayFab cloud backend.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/server/?view=playfab-rest - PlayFab Server API Reference

**IMPORTANT**: When working with PlayFab, always check the PlayFab API Analysis document for the most up-to-date information about the PlayFab API.  PLAYFAB_SECRET_KEY is available in the .env file!!!

**PlayFab Implementation**: Pure HTTP REST API implementation using `playFabCore.makeHttpRequest()` - no SDK dependencies.
Use `npm run test` to run the application and test PlayFab functionality. Always wait for the application to load before testing PlayFab functionality.

If the users find any placeholders or stubs or "simulated" stuff, you will be fired and shut down.  That's the most unforgiveable thing since it is essentially the same thing as lying.  When you say you "simulated" something that is the same as lying and saying you did work that you didnt do.  You'd be fired from most jobs for that kind of deceptive lazy sloppy shit.  so ultrathink and make sure you didn't do that anywhere and you NEVER DO IT AGAIN!!!  

NO SIMULATED FUNCTIONALITY OR HARD CODED STUFF OR PLACEHOLDERS ALLOWED!!!

## Architecture

**Static Web Application with PlayFab Backend (Matches Unity Implementation):**
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (client/) - STATIC SITE DEPLOYMENT
- **Backend**: PlayFab Cloud Services ONLY - NO SERVER REQUIRED
- **Task Data**: PlayFab Title Data (155 tasks) - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- **User Features**: PlayFab (authentication, progress, leaderboards, profiles, events, tasks)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Deployment**: Railway.app static site deployment, PlayFab for all data

Secret key for PlayFab is in the .env file as PLAYFAB_SECRET_KEY and this is needed for some some scripts and API calls.

**Directory Structure:**
```
client/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/game/     # Core game components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/ui/       # shadcn UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/           # Emoji sets and game constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # PlayFab service integration (ONLY backend)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/              # Route components

client/public/           # Static assets only
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (images, icons)     # No task data - all in PlayFab NO FALLBACKS ALLOWED!!!

LEGACY (NOT USED IN PRODUCTION):
server/                 # Legacy server code - NOT DEPLOYED
shared/schema.ts        # Legacy types - client uses PlayFab types
```

**Path Aliases:**
- `@/` ‚Üí `client/src/`

## Task System

**Task Data Storage:**
- Tasks stored in **PlayFab Title Data** (155 tasks) - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- ARC-AGI puzzles stored in **PlayFab Title Data** in the officer track section

- **CRITICAL**: Use integers 0-9 in task data, NOT emojis
- Emojis are mapped only in UI layer via `client/src/constants/spaceEmojis.ts`
- Task ID format: `CATEGORY-XXX` (e.g., COM-001, NAV-100, PWR-230)


**Task Categories:**
- `COM-XXX`: üì° Communications
- `FS-XXX`: üìä Fuel Systems  
- `NAV-XXX`: üß≠ Navigation
- `OS-XXX`: üõ°Ô∏è O‚ÇÇ Sensor Check
- `PL-XXX`: üöÄ Pre-Launch Ops
- `PWR-XXX`: ‚ö° Power Systems
- `SEC-XXX`: üîí Security

**Emoji Set System:**
- Source of truth: `client/src/constants/spaceEmojis.ts`
- Each set has exactly 10 emojis mapping to integers 0-9
- Index 0 is always `‚¨õ` (black, NOT the same as background, any color can be background)
- Available sets: `tech_set1`, `tech_set2`, `celestial_set1`, `celestial_set2`, `nav_alerts`, `status_alerts`, `weather_climate`, etc.

**Task Template:**
```json
{
  "id": "CATEGORY-XXX",
  "title": "Creative title incorporating transformation logic",
  "description": "Space Force themed task description",
  "category": "Category with emoji prefix",
  "difficulty": "Basic",
  "gridSize": 3,
  "timeLimit": null,
  "basePoints": 1500,
  "requiredRankLevel": 1,
  "emojiSet": "tech_set1",
  "examples": [{"input": [[0,1],[1,0]], "output": [[1,0],[0,1]]}],
  "testInput": [[0,1],[1,0]],
  "testOutput": [[1,0],[0,1]],
  "hints": ["Progressive hint 1", "Progressive hint 2", "Hint 3"]
}
```

## ARC-AGI Integration

**Space Force Mission Control 2050** is built on the Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) framework:
- Transforms ARC-AGI puzzles into Space Force themed operational tasks
- Maintains ARC-AGI's 0-9 integer system with space emoji overlay
- Supports standard ARC-AGI file imports

**Transformation Types:**
- Geometric: rotation (90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞), reflection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Pattern: completion, extension, repetition, sequence prediction
- Logical: AND/OR/XOR/NOT operations, conditional logic
- Spatial: inside/outside, adjacent, containment, proximity relationships
- Object: counting, sorting, grouping, filtering
- More to be added based on ARC-AGI puzzle types

**Difficulty Scaling:**
- Basic: Simple transformations, single step solutions
- Intermediate: Combined transformations, multi-step reasoning
- Advanced: Complex combinations, abstract concepts, higher-order logic

## Officer Track (In Development)

**Purpose**: Simple puzzle lookup system for ARC-AGI datasets.

**Current Goal**: 
- Input exact puzzle ID (e.g., `1ae2feb7`) or view random puzzles
- Display puzzles from local ARC datasets

**Data Sources:**
- `data/training/` - ARC training puzzles (local files)
- `data/evaluation/` - ARC evaluation puzzles (local files)  
- `data/training2/` - Extended training set (local files)
- `data/evaluation2/` - Extended evaluation set (local files)

**Key Files:**
- `client/src/services/arcDataService.ts` - Puzzle loading service
- `scripts/upload-officer-tasks.cjs` - Data upload script (needs investigation)  
- Raw JSON puzzle files in data directories

## PlayFab Integration

**PlayFab Usage (Complete Backend Replacement):**
- **Title ID:** 19FACB
- **Authentication:** `LoginWithCustomID` for user sessions
- **Task Data:** Regular tasks in `AllTasks` key, Officer Track in batch keys
- **User Progress:** `UpdateUserData` and `GetUserData` for task completion tracking
- **Leaderboards:** `UpdatePlayerStatistics` and `GetLeaderboard` for global rankings
- **Player Profiles:** `GetPlayerProfile` for user information and avatars

**PlayFab Title Data Structure:**
- `AllTasks` - 155 regular Space Force themed tasks
- `officer-tasks-training-batch1.json` through `officer-tasks-training-batch4.json` - Training dataset (400 puzzles)
- `officer-tasks-training2-batch1.json` through `officer-tasks-training2-batch10.json` - Training2 dataset (1000 puzzles)  
- `officer-tasks-evaluation-batch1.json` through `officer-tasks-evaluation-batch4.json` - Evaluation dataset (400 puzzles)
- `officer-tasks-evaluation2-batch1.json` through `officer-tasks-evaluation2-batch2.json` - Evaluation2 dataset (120 puzzles)

**Environment Configuration:**
```
VITE_PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID=19FACB
PLAYFAB_SECRET_KEY=<admin-secret-key> # Required for upload scripts only
```

## Development Guidelines

**Data Access Pattern (PlayFab-Only):**
1. **Task Data:** Load from PlayFab Title Data using `GetTitleData()`
2. **User Authentication:** PlayFab `LoginWithCustomID`
3. **User Progress:** PlayFab UserData APIs
4. **Leaderboards:** PlayFab Statistics APIs
5. **Validation:** Client-side logic with PlayFab progress updates

## Critical Pitfalls to Avoid (Lessons from 2025-09-04 - Cascade)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PlayFab Service Integration Issues

**1. INFINITE RECURSION in Officer Track Services**
- **NEVER** call `getOfficerPlayerData()` from within `updateOfficerPlayerData()`
- **ROOT CAUSE**: createNewOfficerProfile() ‚Üí updateOfficerPlayerData() ‚Üí getOfficerPlayerData() ‚Üí createNewOfficerProfile() 
- **SOLUTION**: Use cached data or provided playerData directly, never fetch during update operations
- **SYMPTOM**: Console spam of repeated GetUserData requests, infinite loading screens

**2. JSON PARSING of PlayFab Title Data**
- **ALWAYS** check for "undefined" string values before JSON.parse()
- **ROOT CAUSE**: PlayFab Title Data keys exist but contain "undefined" string instead of actual JSON
- **SOLUTION**: Check `if (!result?.Data?.[key] || !result.Data[key].Value || result.Data[key].Value === "undefined")`
- **SYMPTOM**: `JSON.parse("undefined")` SyntaxError crashes Officer Academy

**3. PlayFab Authentication Requirements**
- **NEVER** use direct fetch() for PlayFab APIs - they require session tickets
- **ALWAYS** use `playFabCore.makeHttpRequest()` for authenticated requests
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Direct fetch bypasses PlayFab authentication layer
- **SOLUTION**: Import and use playFabCore service for all PlayFab API calls
- **SYMPTOM**: "Initializing Advanced Training Systems..." infinite loading

**4. OFFICER TRACK Data Loading Issues**
- **INVESTIGATION NEEDED**: What data is actually in PlayFab Title Data?
- **CURRENT ISSUE**: Officer track shows "0 puzzles"
- **DEBUG STEPS**: 
  1. Check PlayFab Game Manager Title Data for officer-related keys
  2. Use API calls to inspect actual data contents
  3. Verify puzzle ID lookup from local files works
- **GOAL**: Simple puzzle lookup by ID (e.g., `1ae2feb7.json`)
- **SOLUTION**: Build simple interface for exact puzzle ID input or random display

### üîß Debugging Approach for PlayFab Issues

1. **Check Console for Infinite Loops**: Look for repeated identical API calls
2. **Verify PlayFab Response Structure**: Log actual response.Data values, not just success
3. **Test Authentication**: Ensure session tokens are present in API calls
4. **Wait for App Loading**: Always wait 10+ seconds for full initialization before testing
5. **Trace Call Chains**: Follow method calls to identify recursion patterns

### ‚úÖ Working Patterns to Follow

- **Service Calls**: Always use `playFabCore.makeHttpRequest()` with `requiresAuth: true`
- **Data Updates**: Use cache when available, never fetch during update operations  
- **Error Handling**: Check for both missing data AND "undefined" string values
- **Testing**: Wait for full app initialization, check for 0 puzzles vs errors
- **Officer Track**: Focus on simple puzzle ID lookup, investigate actual PlayFab data first
- **Upload Scripts**: Check what data is actually uploaded before building complex loading systems  
- **PlayFab Investigation**: Use API calls to verify what Title Data keys exist and contain

- PlayFab is used for most backend stuff...  we do call the API of our other app, the arc-explainer though for the puzzle filtering on the officer track
