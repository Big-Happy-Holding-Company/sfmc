 Looking at the current system, I can see several critical issues that need addressing:

  Current Multi-Test Problem Analysis

  Current Logic Issues:
  1. Assessment Auto-Advance: onSolve callback triggers after ANY PlayFab validation success, but for multi-test puzzles, this happens when only 1 test is    
   complete
  2. Validation Timing: validatePuzzleWithPlayFab() only runs when allTestsCompleted is true (frontend validation of ALL tests passes)
  3. User Confusion: Users must manually click tabs to navigate between test cases
  4. Assessment Context: Assessment needs different behavior than regular Officer Track

  Core UX Problems:
  1. Silent Multi-Tests: Users don't realize puzzle has multiple tests until they see tabs
  2. Manual Navigation: Users must click tabs instead of natural progression
  3. Validation Confusion: When to submit vs when all tests are complete
  4. Progress Feedback: Unclear what happens when you complete 1 of 3 tests

● Optimal UX Design for Multi-Test Puzzles

  Assessment Context (Streamlined Experience):
  - Goal: Research participants should flow smoothly without confusion
  - Multi-Test Behavior: Auto-advance through test cases within a puzzle
  - User Experience: "Solve test 1 → Auto-advance to test 2 → Solve test 2 → Auto-advance to test 3 → Complete puzzle → Next assessment puzzle"
  - Visual Feedback: Clear indication "Test 1 of 3 complete. Moving to Test 2..."
  - No Manual Navigation: Users never click tabs - system guides them

  Regular Officer Track (Full Control Experience):
  - Goal: Power users can explore and practice freely
  - Multi-Test Behavior: Manual navigation with clear progress indicators
  - User Experience: Full test case navigation, can jump between tests, retry specific tests
  - Visual Feedback: Rich progress tracking, completion badges, strategic overview

  well maybe a few differences

● You're right - let me think about the key differences between assessment and regular Officer Track for multi-test puzzles:

  Key Differences Between Contexts

  Assessment Context:
  - Streamlined Flow: Auto-advance through test cases AND to next assessment puzzle
  - No Backtracking: Can't go back to previous tests once completed
  - Minimal UI: Clean, distraction-free interface
  - Progress Pressure: Clear indication this is timed/evaluated
  - Error Handling: Failed attempts still advance (research data collection)

  Regular Officer Track:
  - Full Exploration: Can navigate freely between test cases
  - Practice Mode: Can retry, experiment, go back to previous tests
  - Rich Feedback: Detailed scoring, hints, performance metrics
  - No Time Pressure: Take as long as needed
  - Mastery Focus: Must complete all tests correctly to "solve" puzzle

● Robust Multi-Test Progression Logic

  Core Validation States:
  1. Individual Test Complete: Frontend validation passes for current test
  2. All Tests Complete: Frontend validation passes for ALL tests
  3. PlayFab Validation Success: Server confirms puzzle solution is correct

  Assessment Flow:
  - Test 1 complete → Auto-advance to Test 2 (no submit needed)
  - Test 2 complete → Auto-advance to Test 3 (no submit needed)
  - Test 3 complete → Submit to PlayFab → Next assessment puzzle
  - Failed attempt → Still advance (collect attempt data)

  Officer Track Flow:
  - Any test complete → User can manually navigate or continue
  - All tests complete → Enable PlayFab submission
  - PlayFab success → Puzzle marked as solved, stay on puzzle or return to selection
