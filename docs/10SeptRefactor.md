# September 10 Architecture Refactoring - Developer Brief

## Issue Fixed
PlayFab data access was broken. Web app couldn't access uploaded puzzle data despite successful E2E tests. Root cause: mixed Admin API and Client API usage without proper strategy pattern.

## Architecture Changes Completed

### New Core Services Created
- `apiStrategy.ts` - Strategy pattern for Admin vs Client API selection
- `authManager.ts` - Unified authentication handling for all services  
- `requestManager.ts` - Centralized HTTP request handling with retry logic
- `idConverter.ts` - Single source of truth for ID format conversions

### Design Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service handles one concern only
- **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Eliminated duplicate auth and ID conversion logic
- **Strategy Pattern**: Automatic API endpoint selection based on operation type

## Work Remaining

### Services to Refactor (High Priority)
1. `core.ts` - Remove mixed API patterns, delegate to new strategy system
2. `arcDataService.ts` - Remove authentication concerns, use new request manager  
3. `officerTrack.ts` - Replace duplicate auth logic with centralized manager

### Integration Required
- Update all existing services to use new centralized components
- Replace scattered ID conversion calls with idConverter service
- Test Admin API vs Client API automatic selection

### Testing Needed
- Verify web app can now access PlayFab Title Data
- Confirm ARC puzzle loading works correctly
- Test authentication flow with new manager

## Expected Result
PlayFab data access should work correctly with clean separation of concerns. Each service focused on single responsibility. Zero duplication of authentication or ID conversion logic.

## Priority Order
1. Refactor core services to use new components
2. Test PlayFab data access functionality  
3. Update remaining services incrementally
4. Create integration tests

## Time Estimate
- Core refactoring: 2-3 hours remaining
- Testing and validation: 1 hour
- Documentation updates: 30 minutes
