# Officer Track Refactor Plan - September 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

Complete rewrite of `OfficerTrack.tsx` from a 1,350-line "bloated, hardcoded, hallucinated disaster" into a focused, modular system for puzzle discovery. The new system leverages the arc-explainer API as the primary data source to help officers find the hardest puzzles to challenge their candidates.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified
- **Massive monolith**: 1,350 lines mixing data fetching, state management, and UI
- **Mobile-locked layout**: Fixed layouts that don't scale to different screen sizes
- **Poor API integration**: Not leveraging rich arc-explainer endpoints effectively  
- **Hardcoded limits**: Arbitrary 50/1000 puzzle limits excluding most data
- **Filtering regression**: 0% accuracy puzzles (should be ~90% of dataset) filtered out
- **Mixed responsibilities**: Single file handling everything from API calls to grid rendering

### Arc-Explainer API Intelligence (Source: docs/api-guide.md)

Based on the authoritative API guide, here are the key endpoints we'll leverage:

#### Primary Data Sources
- **`GET /api/puzzle/worst-performing`** - Our main source for discovering difficult puzzles
  - Handles in `PuzzleRepository.ts`
  - Returns puzzles with lowest average accuracy across models
  - Perfect for finding challenges for officer candidates

#### Statistics & Analytics  
- **`GET /api/puzzle/accuracy-stats`** - Powered by `getGeneralModelStats()`
  - Returns `accuracyByModel` (comprehensive performance profile)
  - Contains pure accuracy + trustworthiness scores
  - **Note**: Also returns redundant `modelAccuracy` array - we'll use `accuracyByModel`

- **`GET /api/puzzle/general-stats`** - Same as accuracy-stats (confusing naming)
  - Both endpoints use the same underlying function
  - We'll use accuracy-stats for consistency

- **`GET /api/puzzle/performance-stats`** - Handled by `TrustworthinessRepository.ts`
  - Specialized for analyzing `prediction_accuracy_score` and `confidence`
  - Useful for identifying high-confidence wrong answers

- **`GET /api/puzzle/confidence-stats`** - Also in `TrustworthinessRepository.ts`
  - Focus on confidence analysis
  - Helps find overconfident AI failures (our target puzzles)

#### Critical Insights from API Guide
- **Pure accuracy calculation**: `correct_predictions / solver_attempts` (sound logic)
- **Trustworthiness vs Accuracy**: Different metrics with confusing naming
- **Data completeness**: Some puzzles lack performance data (need to handle gracefully)
- **Model performance**: Sorted by `solver_accuracy_percentage DESC`

## New Architecture Design

### Core Philosophy
**Purpose**: Simple puzzle discovery system focusing on AI failures
- Arc-explainer API as single source of truth for difficulty
- Clean arc-ID ↔ PlayFab-ID translation for serving
- Responsive design scaling from mobile to desktop
- Modular components with single responsibilities

### Modular Structure

#### 1. Services Layer (`client/src/services/officer/`)
```typescript
// Enhanced arc-explainer integration
arcExplainerService.ts
  - Leverages worst-performing endpoint as primary
  - Uses accuracy-stats for difficulty categorization
  - Implements intelligent caching (5min TTL)
  - Handles API response variations gracefully

// Difficulty categorization logic
puzzleDifficultyService.ts
  - Impossible: 0% accuracy (should be ~90% of dataset)
  - Extremely Hard: 0-25% accuracy
  - Very Hard: 25-50% accuracy  
  - Challenging: 50-75% accuracy
  - Uses pure accuracy from arc-explainer

// ID translation system
puzzleTranslationService.ts
  - arc-ID (007bbfb7) ↔ PlayFab-ID (ARC-TR-007bbfb7)
  - Handles all dataset prefixes (TR, EV, TR2, EV2)
  - Validation and error handling
  - Bidirectional conversion

// Focused PlayFab integration
playFabPuzzleService.ts
  - Only handles puzzle serving once we have PlayFab ID
  - Solution validation and progress tracking
  - Achievement system integration
```

#### 2. Hooks Layer (`client/src/hooks/officer/`)
```typescript
// Primary data hook
useArcExplainerData.ts
  - Fetches from worst-performing endpoint
  - Implements intelligent caching strategy
  - Handles loading states and errors
  - Provides data refresh capability

// Difficulty filtering
usePuzzleDifficulty.ts  
  - Filters puzzles by AI performance categories
  - Handles zero-accuracy special case
  - Provides difficulty statistics
  - Manages filter state

// Advanced filtering
usePuzzleFiltering.ts
  - Search by puzzle ID
  - Filter by accuracy ranges
  - Sort by different metrics (accuracy, confidence)
  - Combine multiple filter criteria

// Responsive layout
useResponsiveLayout.ts
  - Dynamic grid columns based on screen size
  - Card size adjustments
  - Mobile-first responsive breakpoints
```

#### 3. Components Layer (`client/src/components/officer/`)

```typescript
// New clean orchestration
OfficerTrackNew.tsx
  - Coordinates all components
  - Manages global state
  - Handles navigation
  - Responsive layout orchestration
```

### Responsive Design Strategy

#### Mobile (320px - 768px)
- Single column layout
- Large, touch-friendly cards
- Simplified filtering options
- Drawer-based navigation

#### Tablet (768px - 1024px)  
- 2-3 column grid
- Medium-sized cards
- Side panel filters
- Touch and mouse support

- Advanced filtering sidebar
- Keyboard navigation support

#### Large Desktop (1440px+)
- 5-6 column grid
- Dense information display
- Multiple filter panels
- Power user features

### API Integration Strategy

#### Primary Data Flow
1. **Discovery**: `GET /api/puzzle/worst-performing` identifies hard puzzles
2. **Categorization**: Use accuracy data to bucket by difficulty  
3. **Translation**: Convert arc-ID to PlayFab-ID format
4. **Serving**: PlayFab provides puzzle data for solving
5. **Validation**: PlayFab handles solution checking

#### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when arc-explainer unavailable
- Fallback to PlayFab data if needed
- Clear error messages for users
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

#### Performance Optimization
- Intelligent caching (5 minute TTL)
- Lazy loading of puzzle details
- Debounced search inputs
- Optimistic UI updates

## Conclusion

This refactor transforms the Officer Track from a monolithic disaster into a focused, modular system that actually serves its purpose: helping officers find the most challenging puzzles for their candidates. By leveraging the arc-explainer API as the primary data source and implementing a clean, responsive architecture, we create a maintainable and user-friendly puzzle discovery platform.

The modular design ensures each component has a single responsibility, making the codebase maintainable and extensible. The responsive approach ensures the system works effectively across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop displays.

Most importantly, by focusing on AI failure patterns and leveraging the rich performance data from arc-explainer, we ensure officers can easily identify the puzzles that will most effectively challenge and train their candidates.
