## Design Notes

### Clear Input→Output Mapping
Each task description now directly relates to the transformation:
- Reflections: Physical scenarios where mirroring makes operational sense
- Rotations: Actual rotating equipment or changing viewpoints
- Patterns: Sequences that follow logical progressions in space operations

### Mixed Difficulty Throughout
Rather than just increasing grid size linearly:
- 2x2 grids appear even in later phases for quick wins
- 5x5 grids introduced early to test capability
- Complexity comes from transformation subtlety, not just size

### Concrete Space Operations
Every task represents something a real space operator might encounter:
- Solar panel configurations
- Docking procedures
- Navigation displays
- Safety systems
- Communication arrays

### Pattern Recognition Focus
Players will see examples like:
- Input: Undeployed solar panel → Output: Deployed (mirrored) configuration
- Input: Horizontal rocket → Output: Vertical rocket (90° rotation)
- Input: Partial beacon sequence → Output: Completed pattern
