# PlayFab Tasks Migration Plan
*Date: September 2, 2025*
*Goal: Make PlayFab the Single Source of Truth for Tasks*

## Overview

Currently Unity and React both use different task sources:
- Unity: `https://sfmc.up.railway.app/api/tasks`
- React: Mixed (server API + incomplete PlayFab service)
- Goal: Both platforms use PlayFab Title Data as single source

## Architecture After Migration

```
PlayFab Title Data (Single Source of Truth)
    ↓
    ├── Unity → GetTitleData() → Tasks
    └── React → playFabService.getAllTasks() → Tasks
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Task Migration ✅
**Objective**: Upload all current server tasks to PlayFab Title Data

1. **Build migration script** 
   - Read all tasks from current server storage
   - Format for PlayFab Title Data structure
   - Upload via PlayFab Admin API or Title Data management

2. **Validate migration**
   - Test PlayFab GetTitleData() returns all tasks
   - Verify task format matches schema expectations
   - Confirm 155+ tasks are properly stored

3. **Test data integrity**
   - Compare server vs PlayFab task data
   - Validate JSON structure and required fields
   - Ensure emoji sets and examples are preserved

### Phase 2: Update React ✅
**Objective**: Switch React from server API to PlayFab service

1. **Update task loading components**
   - Replace `fetch('/api/tasks')` with `playFabService.getAllTasks()`
   - Update FIQTest and other task-consuming pages
   - Handle PlayFab authentication requirements

2. **Fix type compatibility**
   - Resolve differences between PlayFabTask and shared Task types
   - Add type conversion if needed
   - Ensure proper error handling

3. **Test React functionality**
   - Verify all task pages load from PlayFab
   - Test task filtering and selection
   - Confirm interactive grids work with PlayFab data

### Phase 3: Update Unity (Future)
**Objective**: Switch Unity from server API to PlayFab GetTitleData()

1. **Replace Unity API calls**
   - Update PlayFabManager to use GetTitleData() instead of server API
   - Maintain all other PlayFab functionality (auth, leaderboards, events)
   - Keep local caching mechanism

2. **Test Unity with PlayFab data**
   - Verify all tasks load correctly
   - Test task progression and completion
   - Confirm performance is acceptable

### Phase 4: Clean Up (Future)
**Objective**: Remove server dependency completely

1. **Remove server components**
   - Eliminate `/api/tasks` endpoint
   - Clean up unused server infrastructure
   - Update deployment configs

2. **Finalize architecture**
   - Both platforms using identical PlayFab data
   - Single source of truth achieved
   - Simplified maintenance and updates

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All tasks available in PlayFab Title Data
- ✅ React loads tasks from PlayFab successfully  
- ✅ Task functionality works identically to server version
- ⏳ Unity switches to PlayFab (future phase)
- ⏳ Server API removed (future phase)

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Ensure zero downtime for users
- Validate data integrity at each step
- Test all task-related functionality after each phase

## Migration Script Requirements

The migration script should:
1. Connect to current server storage system
2. Extract all task data in current format
3. Transform to PlayFab Title Data structure
4. Upload to PlayFab using Admin API
5. Verify successful upload and data integrity
