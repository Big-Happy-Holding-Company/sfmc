# Officer Track Implementation Plan
## Space Force Mission Control - ARC-AGI Integration

**Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Purpose**: Add ARC1 and ARC2 puzzles as an advanced "Officer Track" game mode  
**Complexity**: High - Multi-phase implementation with PlayFab integration  

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Objective
Create a separate, advanced game mode that integrates the standard ARC1 and ARC2 puzzle datasets as "Officer Track" challenges. This will provide experienced players with significantly more complex puzzles while maintaining complete separation from the base game's progression system.

### Key Requirements
- **Complete Separation**: Officer Track must not modify base game tasks or progression
- **PlayFab Integration**: Separate leaderboards, user data, and validation systems
- **ARC Data Integration**: Use raw ARC JSON files without modification
- **Advanced UX**: Military academy theme with prestige ranking system
- **Performance**: Handle large dataset efficiently with lazy loading

### Data Sources  - USE ONLY UNIQUE PUZZLE IDs!  Some puzzles are duplicated between sets.
- `data/training/` - ~800 ARC1 training puzzles
- `data/training2/` - Additional ARC2 training puzzles  
- `data/evaluation/` - ~400 ARC1 evaluation puzzles
- `data/evaluation2/` - Additional ARC2 evaluation puzzles

  );
};
```

## ⚠️ Critical Considerations

### 1. Data Separation
- Officer Track must never modify existing task data
- PlayFab statistics must use separate keys (`OfficerTrackPoints` vs `LevelPoints`)
- User data must be completely isolated

### 2. Performance Management
- ARC dataset contains 1000+ puzzles - implement pagination
- Use lazy loading to prevent memory issues
- Cache frequently accessed puzzles

### 3. Validation Security
- ARC solutions must be validated server-side via CloudScript
- Prevent client-side manipulation of scores
- Maintain puzzle integrity

### 4. User Experience
- Ensure clear differentiation from main game
- Provide adequate onboarding for ARC complexity
- Maintain Space Force theming while adding military academy prestige
