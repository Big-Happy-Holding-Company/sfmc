# ARC Puzzle Data Fix - Implementation Plan

## Problem Resolution Summary

**Root Cause**: ARC puzzle data was never uploaded to PlayFab Title Data, causing the web app to find 0 puzzles despite successful API calls.

**Solution**: Successfully uploaded 1,920 real ARC puzzles to PlayFab and verified data accessibility.

## Current Status: FIXED âœ…

### Upload Completed Successfully
- **1,920 puzzles uploaded** across all datasets
- **20 batch files** created in PlayFab Title Data
- **All batches under 976KB limit** (largest was 705KB)
- **Real ARC puzzle files processed** from local data directories

### Dataset Distribution
```
training:    400 puzzles (4 batches)
training2:  1000 puzzles (10 batches)  
evaluation:  400 puzzles (4 batches)
evaluation2: 120 puzzles (2 batches)
```

### Batch Structure in PlayFab
```
officer-tasks-training-batch1.json    â†’ 100 puzzles (308 KB)
officer-tasks-training-batch2.json    â†’ 100 puzzles (308 KB)
officer-tasks-training-batch3.json    â†’ 100 puzzles (256 KB)
officer-tasks-training-batch4.json    â†’ 100 puzzles (242 KB)
officer-tasks-training2-batch1.json   â†’ 100 puzzles (368 KB)
...and 16 more batches
```

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Improve Robustness (High Priority)
1. **Add Key Discovery System**
   - Create `getAllTitleDataKeys()` method in arcDataService
   - Call PlayFab `GetTitleData` with `Keys: null` to get all keys
   - Filter for `officer-tasks-*-batch*.json` patterns
   - Use discovered keys instead of hardcoded batch lists

2. **Update Search Logic**
   - Replace hardcoded `DATASET_DEFINITIONS.batchCount` 
   - Use dynamically discovered batch keys
   - Handle cases where expected batches don't exist
   - Add proper error handling for missing data

### Phase 2: Clean Up and Security (Medium Priority)
1. **Delete Dangerous Test Script**
   - Remove `scripts/test-officer-track-e2e.cjs`
   - **CRITICAL**: Contains mock/simulated data which is deceptive
   - Replace with real data verification script

2. **Add Data Verification Script**
   - Create `scripts/verify-playfab-data.cjs`
   - Confirms all expected puzzles exist in PlayFab
   - Reports missing batches or data corruption
   - Safe for production use (no mock data)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Error Handling (Low Priority)
1. **Improve Debugging Output**
   - Show discovered vs expected batch keys
   - Log actual puzzle counts per batch
   - Clear error messages when data is missing
   - Remove excessive debug logging from production

2. **Add Data Health Monitoring**
   - Periodic checks that PlayFab data is accessible
   - Alert system for missing or corrupted batches
   - Automatic fallback mechanisms if needed

## Technical Details

### Upload Script Analysis
- **File**: `scripts/upload-officer-tasks.cjs`
- **Function**: Reads real JSON files from data directories
- **Process**: Transforms ARC format â†’ Officer Track format â†’ PlayFab batches
- **Security**: Uses proper Admin API with secret key authentication
- **Batching**: Automatically splits large datasets into <976KB chunks

### ID Format Mapping
```
ARC File:     27a28665.json
Officer ID:   ARC-TR-27a28665 (training dataset)
Officer ID:   ARC-EV-27a28665 (evaluation dataset)
Filename:     27a28665 (for search)
```

### PlayFab API Structure
```javascript
// Successful upload creates:
{
  "officer-tasks-training-batch1.json": {
    "Value": "[{id: 'ARC-TR-007bbfb7', filename: '007bbfb7', ...}]"
  }
}
```

## Verification Status

### âœ… Upload Verification Complete
- All 1,920 puzzles confirmed uploaded
- PlayFab Title Data contains 22 keys (20 officer + 2 other)
- Sample puzzle loading works correctly
- ID conversion functions tested and working

### ðŸ”„ Web App Testing Needed
After implementing key discovery system:
1. Test puzzle search by ID (e.g., "27a28665")
2. Verify officer track loads puzzles correctly  
3. Confirm ARC-Explainer API integration works
4. Test difficulty filtering and metadata merging

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- **Data Loss**: All source files preserved, re-upload possible
- **PlayFab Limits**: Well under size and API rate limits
- **Authentication**: Proper secret key usage verified

### Medium Risk Items  
- **Cache Timing**: PlayFab data may take 15 minutes to propagate
- **Batch Discovery**: New logic needs testing with real data
- **Error Handling**: Need graceful degradation if batches missing

### High Risk Items (Resolved)
- ~~**No Real Data**: Data was never uploaded~~ âœ… FIXED
- ~~**Mock Dependencies**: E2E test used fake data~~ â†’ Will be deleted

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Web app successfully loads puzzles by ID
- [ ] Key discovery system finds all 20 batch files
- [ ] Search logic works without hardcoded batch counts
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] Mock E2E test script deleted
- [ ] Real verification script created and working
- [ ] No simulated/fake data in codebase
- [ ] Security review passed

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] Production debugging output optimized
- [ ] Data health monitoring implemented
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms tested
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Commands for Implementation

```bash
# Re-run upload if needed
node scripts/upload-officer-tasks.cjs

# Verify data exists (after implementing discovery)
node scripts/verify-playfab-data.cjs  # (to be created)

# Test web app
npm run dev
# Navigate to Officer Track and test puzzle loading
```

## Final Notes

The core issue is resolved - real ARC puzzle data now exists in PlayFab and is accessible. The remaining work is about making the system more robust and cleaning up potentially confusing test code.

**Priority**: Implement key discovery system first, as it will make puzzle loading work reliably. The cleanup tasks can be done after confirming the web app functions correctly.
