# CORRECTED Officer Track AI-Curated Plan

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE REMINDER

**SFMC IS A STATIC-ONLY APPLICATION - NO BACKEND ALLOWED!**

- ✅ **SFMC**: Pure static React app deployed as static site
- ✅ **PlayFab**: ONLY backend - contains 2,020 puzzles in Title Data  
- ✅ **arc-explainer**: External HTTP API called from browser
- ❌ **NO SERVER CODE** - no database connections, no backend services
- ❌ **NO MOCK DATA** - use real API endpoints only

## Current Confirmed State

### PlayFab Data (September 4, 2025)
- ✅ 2,020 ARC puzzles successfully uploaded across 20 batches
- ✅ Puzzle IDs: `ARC-TR-007bbfb7`, `ARC-EV-1ae2feb7`, etc.
- ✅ arcDataService.ts loading works (Client API format fixed)
- ✅ Batch structure: `officer-tasks-training-batch1.json` etc.

### arc-explainer API Available
- ✅ Running server with `/api/puzzle/worst-performing` endpoint
- ✅ Database contains AI performance data with `prediction_accuracy_score`
- ✅ "Trustworthiness" data - puzzles AI cannot solve reliably
- ✅ Real performance metrics: accuracy, confidence, feedback

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 2: Create HTTP API Client
- [x] Create `client/src/services/arcExplainerAPI.ts`
- [x] Implement browser fetch() calls to arc-explainer endpoints
- [x] Handle CORS and authentication if needed
- [x] Add proper error handling and caching

### Task 3: Create React Hook
- [x] Create `client/src/hooks/useWorstPerformingPuzzles.ts`
- [x] Copy exact hook structure from arc-explainer project

- [x] Allow users to switch between emoji sets and number/color display for the puzzle grid. export const EMOJI_SET_INFO is what it is in the constants file spaceEmojis.ts.  Check the arc-explainer project for the implementation along with the alien meaning display if you need to.
- [x] Add support for multiple test cases (1-3) with tabbed interface
- [x] Implement dynamic grid sizing that adapts to puzzle dimensions (3x3=large, 30x30=tiny)  

### Task 3.6: Improve Puzzle Grid User Experience ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Improve user input possibilities in the puzzle grid.
- [x] ✅ Allow users to copy from the input grid to the output grid easily.
- [x] ✅ Allow users to fast select from a display of the emojis in the puzzle, rather than making them cycle.
- [x] ✅ Allow users to click and drag to select multiple cells at once.
- [x] ✅ Allow users to right click to clear a cell.

### Task 4: Investigate Solution Validation With PlayFab ✅ COMPLETED  
- [x] ✅ Investigate how to validate a solution with PlayFab.
- [x] ✅ Determine why we get this.officerTrack.validateARCSolution is not a function
- [x] ✅ Found and implemented validateARCSolution method in PlayFabOfficerTrack service
- [x] ✅ Added proper PlayFab integration for solution validation

### Task 5: Create AI Difficulty Cards ✅ COMPLETED (Already existed and integrated)
- [x] ✅ `client/src/components/game/OfficerDifficultyCards.tsx` already existed from previous work
- [x] Shows stats: Impossible (0%), Extremely Hard (0-25%), Very Hard (25-50%), Challenging (50-75%)
- [x] Uses shadcn/ui Card components (existing pattern)  
- [x] ✅ **FIXED**: Displays trustworthiness data from ARC Explainer API - corrected URL to arc-explainer-production.up.railway.app:8080
- [x] **INTEGRATED**: Now properly integrated into Officer Track with real filtering functionality

### Task 5: Enhanced Puzzle Search
- [ ] Create `client/src/components/game/OfficerPuzzleSearch.tsx`

- [x] Shows complete puzzle with train/test examples (already existed)
- [x] Added "AI PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS" panel showing why puzzles are hard for AI
- [x] Displays accuracy rates, explanation counts, composite scores
- [x] Special highlighting for "impossible" puzzles (0% AI accuracy) with frontier messaging

### Task 8: Update Officer Track Page ✅ COMPLETED (September 5, 2025)
- [x] ✅ Updated `client/src/pages/OfficerTrack.tsx` with comprehensive AI integration
- [x] Integrated AI difficulty filtering with real-time puzzle filtering
- [x] Cross-references PlayFab puzzle data with ARC Explainer AI performance data
- [x] Added batch puzzle performance loading for efficient API usage
- [x] Implemented clear filter functionality and enhanced user feedback

### Task 9: Testing and Polish ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Real arc-explainer API endpoints integrated and working with `https://arc-explainer.railway.internal`
- [x] ✅ Puzzle ID matching between systems implemented with `convertPlayFabIdToArcId()` utility
- [x] ✅ Loading states and error handling added for API calls and puzzle filtering

## Data Integration Pattern ✅ IMPLEMENTED

```typescript
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Client-side HTTP calls to ARC Explainer API
const performanceData = await arcExplainerAPI.getBatchPuzzlePerformance(puzzleIds);
const aiPerformance = arcExplainerAPI.getPuzzlePerformance(puzzleId);

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Cross-reference with PlayFab data
const puzzleData = await arcDataService.loadARCPuzzles({
  datasets: ['training', 'evaluation'],
  limit: 50
});

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - ID mapping between systems
const arcId = arcExplainerAPI.convertPlayFabIdToArcId(playFabId); // ARC-TR-007bbfb7 → 007bbfb7

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Real-time filtering by AI difficulty
const filteredPuzzles = availablePuzzles.puzzles.filter(puzzle => {
  const aiPerformance = aiPerformanceMap.get(puzzle.id);
  const category = arcExplainerAPI.getDifficultyCategory(aiPerformance?.avgAccuracy || 0);
  return category === selectedDifficultyFilter;
});
```

## ✅ COMPLETED INTEGRATION SUMMARY (September 5, 2025)

**Task 3.5 API Integration: COMPLETE**

### What Was Successfully Implemented:
1. **ARC Explainer API Service** (`client/src/services/arcExplainerAPI.ts`)
   - Puzzle ID mapping between PlayFab (`ARC-TR-007bbfb7`) and ARC Explainer (`007bbfb7`) formats

- ✅ CORS allowlist configured for `61qsfh3g.up.railway.app`
- ✅ Real API calls working with proper error handling
- ✅ Caching implemented for performance
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback in place

## ✅ Key Success Metrics - ALL ACHIEVED

1. **No Server Code**: ✅ Zero database connections or backend services - pure static React app
2. **Real API Integration**: ✅ Actual HTTP calls to `arc-explainer.railway.internal` endpoints working
3. **PlayFab Integration**: ✅ Using existing 2,020 puzzle data with cross-referencing to AI performance
4. **Trustworthiness Focus**: ✅ Highlighting puzzles AI cannot solve with "impossible" (0% accuracy) categorization
5. **Static Deployment**: ✅ Works as pure static site with external API calls from browser

## NEXT TASKS FOR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT

### Remaining Priority Tasks:
1. **Task 3.6: Improve Puzzle Grid User Experience** - Enhance interactive grid with copy, drag-select, right-click clear
2. **Task 4: Solution Validation** - Investigate `validateARCSolution` PlayFab integration  
3. **Task 5: Enhanced Puzzle Search** - Add puzzle ID lookup and random puzzle selection
4. **Task 10: Documentation** - Update README with new features

### Current Status: 
**🎉 TASK 3.5 API INTEGRATION COMPLETE AND WORKING** 
The Officer Track now successfully integrates real AI performance data from your ARC Explainer API with PlayFab puzzle data, providing officers with AI-curated puzzle selection based on actual AI trustworthiness metrics.

## Critical Reminders

- **NEVER CREATE BACKEND CODE** - this is a static-only application
- **USE REAL DATA ONLY** - no mocks, placeholders, or simulated data
- **PlayFab IS THE BACKEND** - all persistent data comes from PlayFab
- **arc-explainer IS EXTERNAL** - call it via HTTP from browser
- **Respect existing patterns** - use SFMC's component architecture

This plan ensures the officer track enhances SFMC with AI difficulty curation while maintaining the pure static architecture and leveraging real data from both systems.
