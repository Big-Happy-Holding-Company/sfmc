# CORRECTED Officer Track AI-Curated Plan

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE REMINDER

**SFMC IS A STATIC-ONLY APPLICATION - NO BACKEND ALLOWED!**

- ✅ **SFMC**: Pure static React app deployed as static site
- ✅ **PlayFab**: ONLY backend - contains 2,020 puzzles in Title Data  
- ✅ **arc-explainer**: External HTTP API called from browser
- ❌ **NO SERVER CODE** - no database connections, no backend services
- ❌ **NO MOCK DATA** - use real API endpoints only

## Current Confirmed State

### PlayFab Data (September 4, 2025)
- ✅ 2,020 ARC puzzles successfully uploaded across 20 batches
- ✅ Puzzle IDs: `ARC-TR-007bbfb7`, `ARC-EV-1ae2feb7`, etc.
- ✅ arcDataService.ts loading works (Client API format fixed)
- ✅ Batch structure: `officer-tasks-training-batch1.json` etc.

### arc-explainer API Available
- ✅ Running server with `/api/puzzle/worst-performing` endpoint
- ✅ Database contains AI performance data with `prediction_accuracy_score`
- ✅ "Trustworthiness" data - puzzles AI cannot solve reliably
- ✅ Real performance metrics: accuracy, confidence, feedback

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 2: Create HTTP API Client

## Data Integration Pattern ✅ IMPLEMENTED

```typescript
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Client-side HTTP calls to ARC Explainer API
const performanceData = await arcExplainerAPI.getBatchPuzzlePerformance(puzzleIds);
const aiPerformance = arcExplainerAPI.getPuzzlePerformance(puzzleId);

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Cross-reference with PlayFab data
const puzzleData = await arcDataService.loadARCPuzzles({
  datasets: ['training', 'evaluation'],
  limit: 50
});

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - ID mapping between systems
const arcId = arcExplainerAPI.convertPlayFabIdToArcId(playFabId); // ARC-TR-007bbfb7 → 007bbfb7

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Real-time filtering by AI difficulty
const filteredPuzzles = availablePuzzles.puzzles.filter(puzzle => {
  const aiPerformance = aiPerformanceMap.get(puzzle.id);
  const category = arcExplainerAPI.getDifficultyCategory(aiPerformance?.avgAccuracy || 0);
  return category === selectedDifficultyFilter;
});
```

## Critical Reminders

- **NEVER CREATE BACKEND CODE** - this is a static-only application
- **USE REAL DATA ONLY** - no mocks, placeholders, or simulated data
- **PlayFab IS THE BACKEND** - all persistent data comes from PlayFab
- **arc-explainer IS EXTERNAL** - call it via HTTP from browser
- **Respect existing patterns** - use SFMC's component architecture

This plan ensures the officer track enhances SFMC with AI difficulty curation while maintaining the pure static architecture and leveraging real data from both systems.
