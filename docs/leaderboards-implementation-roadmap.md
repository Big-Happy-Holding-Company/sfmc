- ✅ Two active leaderboard statistics (`LevelPoints`, `OfficerTrackPoints`)
- ✅ Comprehensive PlayFab service layer with caching and error handling
- ✅ Rich player profile system with avatars and display names
- ✅ Advanced event logging and analytics data
- ✅ 20+ exploration and management scripts for PlayFab integration

---

## Phase 1: Service Layer Enhancement (1-2 days)

### Task 1.1: Extend Leaderboard Service
**File**: `client/src/services/playfab/leaderboards.ts`
- Add methods for multiple statistics simultaneously
- Implement category-based filtering (COM, NAV, PWR, SEC, etc.)
- Add rank-based leaderboard segmentation
- Create temporal leaderboard support (daily/weekly/monthly)

### Task 1.2: Profile Integration Enhancement  
**File**: `client/src/services/playfab/profiles.ts`
- Enhance bulk profile loading for leaderboard entries
- Add achievement data retrieval
- Implement avatar caching optimizations
- Add social features preparation (friend comparisons)

### Task 1.3: Analytics Service Creation
**File**: `client/src/services/playfab/analytics.ts` (new)
- Aggregate event data for performance leaderboards
- Calculate speed rankings, accuracy metrics
- Track completion streaks and achievement milestones
- Generate player performance summaries

---

## Phase 2: Data Architecture (1 day)

### Task 2.1: Statistics Expansion
**Review**: Current statistics structure in PlayFab Game Manager
- Verify existing `LevelPoints` and `OfficerTrackPoints` configuration
- Plan additional statistics if needed (speed rankings, category leaders)
- Document statistic reset schedules for temporal leaderboards

### Task 2.2: Event Data Mining
**Files**: Review event logging in `client/src/services/playfab/events.ts`
- Map event data to leaderboard categories
- Identify performance metrics for advanced rankings
- Plan event aggregation strategies for temporal data

---

## Phase 3: UI Architecture & Routing (2-3 days)

### Task 3.1: Route Structure Design
**File**: `client/src/App.tsx`
- Add `/leaderboards` primary route
- Plan sub-routes: `/leaderboards/global`, `/leaderboards/category`, `/leaderboards/friends`
- Design navigation integration with existing Header component

### Task 3.2: Component Architecture
**Directory**: `client/src/components/leaderboards/` (new)
- `LeaderboardContainer.tsx` - Main leaderboard page wrapper
- `LeaderboardTabs.tsx` - Tab navigation (Global, Categories, Friends, etc.)
- `LeaderboardTable.tsx` - Core ranking table component
- `PlayerRow.tsx` - Individual player entry with avatar, rank, stats
- `LeaderboardFilters.tsx` - Category, time period, rank filtering
- `PlayerProfile.tsx` - Expandable player details modal
- `RankBadge.tsx` - Military rank display (reuse existing if available)

### Task 3.3: State Management Strategy
**Approach**: Local state with service layer integration
- Use existing PlayFab service pattern (no React Query)
- Implement caching strategy for multiple leaderboard views
- Plan real-time refresh mechanics

---

## Phase 4: Core Implementation (3-4 days)

### Task 4.1: Primary Leaderboard Views
**Priority Order**:
1. **Global Leaderboard** - All players ranked by total points
2. **Category Leaderboards** - Separate rankings by task categories
3. **Rank-Based Leaderboards** - Players segmented by military rank
4. **Officer Track Leaderboard** - ARC puzzle specialists

### Task 4.2: Player Profile Integration
- Display player avatars using existing profile service
- Show military ranks with progression indicators  
- Include achievement badges and completion statistics
- Add "View Profile" functionality with detailed stats

### Task 4.3: Interactive Features
- Click-to-expand player details
- Filter and search functionality
- Sort by different metrics (points, rank, completion rate)
- "Find My Position" quick navigation

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (2-3 days)

### Task 5.1: Temporal Leaderboards
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly competition cycles
- Historical leaderboard data preservation
- Season/period navigation interface
- Reset schedule management

### Task 5.2: Social Features
- Friend system integration (if PlayFab friends available)
- "Players Near Me" ranking view  
- Rank comparison tools
- Challenge/rivalry features

### Task 5.3: Performance Analytics
- Speed leaderboards (fastest completion times)
- Accuracy rankings (fewest attempts to completion)
- Streak tracking (consecutive puzzle completions)
- Category specialization metrics

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Optimization (1-2 days)

### Task 6.1: Performance Optimization
- Implement progressive loading for large leaderboards
- Add pagination for massive datasets
- Optimize avatar loading and caching
- Add loading states and skeleton screens

### Task 6.2: Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure leaderboard tables work on mobile devices
- Implement swipe gestures for tab navigation
- Optimize touch interactions for player profiles

### Task 6.3: Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Handle PlayFab service failures gracefully
- Add offline/cached data display
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests

---

## Technical Considerations

### PlayFab Rate Limits
- Leaderboard API calls are rate-limited
- Implement request batching and caching
- Use existing caching mechanisms in service layer

### Data Freshness
- Balance real-time updates with performance
- Consider WebSocket integration for live updates
- Implement smart refresh strategies

### Scalability
- Current architecture supports thousands of players
- Consider pagination strategies for growth
- Monitor PlayFab service performance metrics

---

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Increase in daily active users viewing leaderboards
- Average time spent on leaderboard pages
- Player profile views and interactions

### Technical Performance
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- Minimal PlayFab API request volume
- High cache hit rates for repeated views

### Feature Adoption
- Usage distribution across leaderboard categories
- Mobile vs desktop engagement patterns
- Social feature interaction rates

## Implementation Notes

### Existing Code Leverage
- Maximum reuse of existing PlayFab service architecture
- Leverage existing UI components (Cards, Buttons, Tables)
- Maintain consistency with existing game theme

### Testing Strategy
- Use existing PlayFab testing scripts for data validation
- Implement component testing for UI interactions
- Load testing with simulated large datasets

### Deployment Considerations
- Feature can be deployed incrementally (phase by phase)
- No backend changes required (pure frontend implementation)
- Uses existing PlayFab configuration and data
