**2025-09-09**: 🔧 VALIDATION MESSAGE FIX - Context-Aware Feedback for Puzzle Results  
- **PROBLEM FIXED**: Misleading "Some test cases failed" message appeared even on single test case puzzles
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Static validation message ignored puzzle structure (single vs multi-test cases)
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
  - Added `getValidationMessage()` function for context-aware feedback
  - **Single test puzzles**: Now show "Solution is incorrect. Try again!"  
  - **Multi-test puzzles**: Now show "Some test cases failed. (X tests required)"
  - **Successful puzzles**: Continue to show "Puzzle solved successfully!"
- **IMPROVED UX**: Users now receive appropriate feedback based on puzzle complexity
- **TECHNICAL APPROACH**: 
  - Client-side fix using `puzzle.test?.length` to determine puzzle structure
  - No server-side changes required - works with existing PlayFab boolean validation
  - Maintains compatibility while improving user experience
- **FILES MODIFIED**: `client/src/components/officer/ResponsivePuzzleSolver.tsx`
- **TESTING REQUIRED**:
  1. Test single test case puzzle with wrong solution → Should show "Solution is incorrect. Try again!"
  2. Test multi test case puzzle with wrong solution → Should show "Some test cases failed. (X tests required)"  
  3. Test any puzzle with correct solution → Should show "Puzzle solved successfully!"
  4. Verify no regression in validation functionality

  3. Verify milestone celebration badges appear for high scores
  4. Check PlayFab events for comprehensive scoring analytics
- **PLAYFAB CONFIGURATION COMPLETE**: ✅ `OfficerTrackPoints` and `ARC2EvalPoints` statistics configured via `scripts/configure-statistics.cjs`

**2025-09-07**: 🎨 DRAW TOOLS SELECTION FILLING FIX - Single Clicks Now Paint with Selected Value
- **CRITICAL UX BUG RESOLVED**: Fixed draw tools that didn't actually fill selections with chosen values
- **PROBLEM**: Single clicks were cycling through values (0→1→2→...→9→0) instead of painting with palette selection
- **ROOT CAUSE**: `handleCellClick` function always used cycling behavior, ignored `selectedValue` from emoji palette
- **SOLUTION**: 
  - Modified `handleCellClick` to detect painting mode via `onCellInteraction` callback presence
  - When `onCellInteraction` exists and `selectedValue` is set, paint with selected value
  - Maintains backward compatibility - cycling behavior preserved when no `onCellInteraction`
- **BEHAVIORAL FIX**: Enhanced `handleEnhancedCellClick` to properly handle painting vs cycling modes
- **CONSISTENCY ACHIEVED**: Single clicks and drag-to-paint now both respect emoji palette selection
- **FILES MODIFIED**: `client/src/components/officer/ResponsiveOfficerGrid.tsx` (lines 130-185)
- **TESTING REQUIRED**: User should verify single clicks paint with selected palette value in Officer Track puzzle solver
- **HOW TO TEST**: 
  1. Go to Officer Track and select a puzzle to solve
  2. Select a value from the emoji palette (numbers 0-9)
  3. Single-click on grid cells - they should change to the selected palette value
  4. Drag across multiple cells - entire selection should fill with selected value

**2025-09-06**: 🔧 PRODUCTION PUZZLE LOADING FIX - Admin API to Client API Migration
- **CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed officer track puzzle loading failures in production environment
- **PROBLEM**: URLs like `https://sfmc.bhhc.us/officer-track/solve/182e5d0f` showing "failed to load puzzle errors" 
- **ROOT CAUSE**: `loadPuzzleFromPlayFab()` was using Admin API (`/Admin/GetTitleData`) requiring secret keys
- **LOCAL VS PRODUCTION**: Worked locally due to `VITE_PLAYFAB_SECRET_KEY` in .env, failed in production (correctly) without secret keys
- **ARCHITECTURE FIX**: 
  - Changed from `/Admin/GetTitleData` to `/Client/GetTitleData` (client-appropriate API)
  - Updated authentication from `requiresAuth: false` (secret key) to `requiresAuth: true` (user session token)
  - Removed secret key dependency from client-side puzzle loading logic
- **SECURITY IMPROVEMENT**: Client applications no longer attempt to use admin credentials
- **DEPLOYMENT READY**: Production puzzle loading now works without requiring secret keys in client builds
- **FILES MODIFIED**: `client/src/services/officerArcAPI.ts` (lines ~385-425)
- **TESTING REQUIRED**: User should verify puzzle loading works at production URL after deployment
- **HOW TO TEST**: Visit `https://sfmc.bhhc.us/officer-track/solve/182e5d0f` - should load puzzle instead of showing error

- **ENHANCED USEOFFICERRPUZZLES HOOK**: 
  - Configurable limits (default 100 instead of hardcoded 50)
  - Runtime sorting strategy changes with `setSortStrategy()`
  - Proper arc-explainer API parameter passing
- **RICH METADATA UTILIZATION**: Now leverages arc-explainer performance data for truly worst-performing puzzle selection

- **ERROR**: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present on the requested resource" from `https://arc-explainer-production.up.railway.app`  
- **ROOT CAUSE**: ARC explainer server lacks CORS middleware to whitelist production domain
- **SOLUTION REQUIRED**: Configure Express.js CORS middleware in ARC explainer project with origin whitelist
- **DOMAINS TO WHITELIST**: `https://sfmc.bhhc.us`, `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5000`
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Add cors npm package with origin function checking allowedOrigins array
- **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE**: Use ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var for security: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://sfmc.bhhc.us`
- **IMPACT**: Officer Track cannot load AI performance data for puzzle difficulty ratings until fixed
- **HOW TO TEST**: After deployment, Officer Track should show AI accuracy percentages and difficulty stats
- **NO FALLBACKS ALLOWED**: Must properly configure CORS, not disable or work around it

**2025-09-04**: Officer Academy infinite loading and PlayFab data parsing fixes - Cascade
- **INFINITE RECURSION FIX**: Fixed updateOfficerPlayerData() infinite loop causing GetUserData spam
- **ROOT CAUSE**: createNewOfficerProfile() → updateOfficerPlayerData() → getOfficerPlayerData() → createNewOfficerProfile() recursion
- **SOLUTION**: Changed updateOfficerPlayerData() to use provided playerData directly when no cache exists instead of fetching
- **JSON PARSING FIX**: Fixed JSON.parse('undefined') error in arcDataService.loadPlayFabTitleData()
- **ROOT CAUSE**: PlayFab Title Data keys exist but contain "undefined" string values instead of actual JSON data
- **SOLUTION**: Added check for "undefined" string values before JSON.parse() attempt
- **AUTHENTICATION FIX**: Updated arcDataService to use authenticated playFabCore.makeHttpRequest() instead of direct fetch
- **RESULT**: Officer Academy loads without infinite loading or JSON parsing errors, shows 0 puzzles gracefully
- **REMAINING ISSUE**: PlayFab Title Data keys exist but are empty - upload script needs to run successfully

**2025-09-03**: FINAL PlayFab race condition fix - CDN loading synchronization
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Race condition between React app initialization and PlayFab CDN script loading
- **SOLUTION**: Added proper CDN loading detection with polling mechanism in core.ts initialization
- **TIMING FIX**: Wait up to 10 seconds for PlayFab global object to be available before proceeding
- **ELIMINATED ERRORS**: No more "PlayFab is not defined" or "UnknownError (-1)" during anonymous login

- **GLOBAL ACCESS**: Added `import 'playfab-web-sdk/src/PlayFab/PlayFabClientApi.js'` to 7 service files
- **ARCHITECTURE FIX**: Added missing getPlayFab() method to PlayFabCore - all service files require this method 
- **IMPORT RESOLUTION**: Fixed broken ES6 import in leaderboards.ts - `import { PlayFabClient } from 'playfab-web-sdk'` 
- **DEV SERVER**: Resolved "Failed to resolve entry for package playfab-web-sdk" Vite build errors
- **API STANDARDIZATION**: Unified ALL PlayFab API calls to use consistent PlayFab.ClientApi.* pattern:
  - leaderboards: PlayFabClient.* and PlayFab.Client.* → PlayFab.ClientApi.*
  - events: PlayFabClient.WritePlayerEvent → PlayFab.ClientApi.WritePlayerEvent
  - profiles: PlayFab.Client.* → PlayFab.ClientApi.* (GetPlayerProfile, UpdateAvatarUrl)
  - validation: PlayFab.Client.ExecuteCloudScript → PlayFab.ClientApi.ExecuteCloudScript
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Fixed hybrid migration state where core.ts was updated but dependent files used old patterns
- **FILES FIXED**: core.ts, auth.ts, leaderboards.ts, events.ts, profiles.ts, tasks.ts, userData.ts, validation.ts

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-02 - 

### Complete PlayFab Migration

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Architecture**: Converted from full-stack to static site with PlayFab-only backend
- **Deployment**: Removed Express server, now deploys as static site via Railway
- **Task Storage**: Removed 155 local task files, now uses PlayFab Title Data exclusively

### Added
- Complete static site deployment configuration (Railway + nixpacks)  DID NOT WORK!!!
- PlayFab-only data flow (matches Unity implementation exactly)
- Client-side task validation with PlayFab progress tracking
- Pure CDN deployment with zero server infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive PlayFab API analysis and security audit
- **API Reference**: Complete endpoint documentation in `docs/playfab-api-analysis.md`

### Changed  
- **package.json**: Removed server build/dev scripts, pure Vite workflow
- **README**: Completely rewritten for static + PlayFab architecture
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated to reflect PlayFab-only data access patterns
- **Build Process**: Static site build only, no server compilation

### Removed
- **server/data/tasks/**: 155 task JSON files (now in PlayFab Title Data)
- **Express Server**: No longer deployed or needed in production
- **API Endpoints**: All functionality moved to PlayFab cloud services

### Security Findings ⚠️
- **CRITICAL**: Task validation currently happens client-side (insecure)
- **Risk**: Scores and leaderboards can be manipulated by players
- **CloudScript**: `GenerateAnonymousName` function exists and works correctly
- **Missing**: `ValidateTaskSolution` CloudScript function for secure validation
- **Recommendation**: Implement server-side validation for production deployment

### Migration Complete
- ✅ **Phase 1**: 155 tasks migrated to PlayFab Title Data  
- ✅ **Phase 2**: React components using PlayFab service
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Static deployment configuration
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Server cleanup and documentation updates
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Security audit and API documentation

### Available PlayFab APIs
- **Admin API**: 30+ endpoints for title management (secret key required)
- **Server API**: 15+ endpoints for server-authoritative operations (secret key required)
- **Client API**: 20+ endpoints for player operations (public access, used by React app)

**Result**: Pure static web app with PlayFab cloud backend - matches Unity implementation.  
**Next**: Implement CloudScript validation for production security.
