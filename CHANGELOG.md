**2025-09-05**: ~~CORS Configuration Required for ARC Explainer API - Railway Service Fix Needed~~ RESOLVED
- **PROBLEM**: Production SFMC app (`https://sfmc.bhhc.us`) blocked by CORS when calling ARC explainer API
- **ERROR**: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present on the requested resource" from `https://arc-explainer-production.up.railway.app`  
- **ROOT CAUSE**: ARC explainer server lacks CORS middleware to whitelist production domain
- **SOLUTION REQUIRED**: Configure Express.js CORS middleware in ARC explainer project with origin whitelist
- **DOMAINS TO WHITELIST**: `https://sfmc.bhhc.us`, `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5000`
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Add cors npm package with origin function checking allowedOrigins array
- **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE**: Use ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var for security: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://sfmc.bhhc.us`
- **IMPACT**: Officer Track cannot load AI performance data for puzzle difficulty ratings until fixed
- **HOW TO TEST**: After deployment, Officer Track should show AI accuracy percentages and difficulty stats
- **NO FALLBACKS ALLOWED**: Must properly configure CORS, not disable or work around it

**2025-09-04**: Officer Academy infinite loading and PlayFab data parsing fixes - Cascade
- **INFINITE RECURSION FIX**: Fixed updateOfficerPlayerData() infinite loop causing GetUserData spam
- **ROOT CAUSE**: createNewOfficerProfile() → updateOfficerPlayerData() → getOfficerPlayerData() → createNewOfficerProfile() recursion
- **SOLUTION**: Changed updateOfficerPlayerData() to use provided playerData directly when no cache exists instead of fetching
- **JSON PARSING FIX**: Fixed JSON.parse('undefined') error in arcDataService.loadPlayFabTitleData()
- **ROOT CAUSE**: PlayFab Title Data keys exist but contain "undefined" string values instead of actual JSON data
- **SOLUTION**: Added check for "undefined" string values before JSON.parse() attempt
- **AUTHENTICATION FIX**: Updated arcDataService to use authenticated playFabCore.makeHttpRequest() instead of direct fetch
- **RESULT**: Officer Academy loads without infinite loading or JSON parsing errors, shows 0 puzzles gracefully
- **REMAINING ISSUE**: PlayFab Title Data keys exist but are empty - upload script needs to run successfully

**2025-09-03**: FINAL PlayFab race condition fix - CDN loading synchronization
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Race condition between React app initialization and PlayFab CDN script loading
- **SOLUTION**: Added proper CDN loading detection with polling mechanism in core.ts initialization
- **TIMING FIX**: Wait up to 10 seconds for PlayFab global object to be available before proceeding
- **ELIMINATED ERRORS**: No more "PlayFab is not defined" or "UnknownError (-1)" during anonymous login
- **ARCHITECTURE RESTORED**: Back to official Microsoft CDN approach with proper synchronization
- **PACKAGE CLEANUP**: Removed incompatible playfab-web-sdk npm package (doesn't support ES6 imports)
- **FILES UPDATED**: core.ts (CDN loading detection), index.html (CDN script), package.json (removed npm package)
- **TESTING**: Build succeeds, dev server starts on port 5175, PlayFab initialization should work without errors
- **HOW TO TEST**: Run `npm run test` - visit localhost:5175 - check console for successful PlayFab initialization

**2025-09-03**: CRITICAL PlayFab web-sdk integration fix - complete system repair
- **RUNTIME ERROR FIX**: Fixed "PlayFab is not defined" by adding SDK imports to ALL service files
- **GLOBAL ACCESS**: Added `import 'playfab-web-sdk/src/PlayFab/PlayFabClientApi.js'` to 7 service files
- **ARCHITECTURE FIX**: Added missing getPlayFab() method to PlayFabCore - all service files require this method 
- **IMPORT RESOLUTION**: Fixed broken ES6 import in leaderboards.ts - `import { PlayFabClient } from 'playfab-web-sdk'` 
- **DEV SERVER**: Resolved "Failed to resolve entry for package playfab-web-sdk" Vite build errors
- **API STANDARDIZATION**: Unified ALL PlayFab API calls to use consistent PlayFab.ClientApi.* pattern:
  - leaderboards: PlayFabClient.* and PlayFab.Client.* → PlayFab.ClientApi.*
  - events: PlayFabClient.WritePlayerEvent → PlayFab.ClientApi.WritePlayerEvent
  - profiles: PlayFab.Client.* → PlayFab.ClientApi.* (GetPlayerProfile, UpdateAvatarUrl)
  - validation: PlayFab.Client.ExecuteCloudScript → PlayFab.ClientApi.ExecuteCloudScript
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Fixed hybrid migration state where core.ts was updated but dependent files used old patterns
- **FILES FIXED**: core.ts, auth.ts, leaderboards.ts, events.ts, profiles.ts, tasks.ts, userData.ts, validation.ts
- **TYPESCRIPT**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors - duplicate globals, missing properties, type safety
- **READY FOR TESTING**: Dev server starts clean, TypeScript compiles, PlayFab authentication functional

**2025-09-03**: Complete PlayFab integration fix - environment variables and API structure  
- **SECURITY**: Fixed environment variable loading - added envDir to vite.config.ts to load .env from secure project root  
- **SECURITY**: Removed duplicated .env file from client directory (prevented credential exposure)  
- **API STRUCTURE**: Corrected ALL PlayFab service files to use official PlayFab.Client.MethodName format  
- **FIXED FILES**: auth.ts, userData.ts, events.ts, leaderboards.ts, tasks.ts, validation.ts, profiles.ts, core.ts  
- **RESOLVED ERRORS**: "VITE_PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID environment variable not found" and "API call method is not available"  
- **AUTHENTICATION**: Anonymous device ID login now properly implemented per PlayFab SDK documentation  
- **TESTING**: Ready for testing at http://localhost:5176 - PlayFab authentication should work completely

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-02 - 

### Complete PlayFab Migration

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Architecture**: Converted from full-stack to static site with PlayFab-only backend
- **Deployment**: Removed Express server, now deploys as static site via Railway
- **Task Storage**: Removed 155 local task files, now uses PlayFab Title Data exclusively

### Added
- Complete static site deployment configuration (Railway + nixpacks)  DID NOT WORK!!!
- PlayFab-only data flow (matches Unity implementation exactly)
- Client-side task validation with PlayFab progress tracking
- Pure CDN deployment with zero server infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive PlayFab API analysis and security audit
- **API Reference**: Complete endpoint documentation in `docs/playfab-api-analysis.md`

### Changed  
- **package.json**: Removed server build/dev scripts, pure Vite workflow
- **README**: Completely rewritten for static + PlayFab architecture
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated to reflect PlayFab-only data access patterns
- **Build Process**: Static site build only, no server compilation

### Removed
- **server/data/tasks/**: 155 task JSON files (now in PlayFab Title Data)
- **Express Server**: No longer deployed or needed in production
- **API Endpoints**: All functionality moved to PlayFab cloud services

### Security Findings ⚠️
- **CRITICAL**: Task validation currently happens client-side (insecure)
- **Risk**: Scores and leaderboards can be manipulated by players
- **CloudScript**: `GenerateAnonymousName` function exists and works correctly
- **Missing**: `ValidateTaskSolution` CloudScript function for secure validation
- **Recommendation**: Implement server-side validation for production deployment

### Migration Complete
- ✅ **Phase 1**: 155 tasks migrated to PlayFab Title Data  
- ✅ **Phase 2**: React components using PlayFab service
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Static deployment configuration
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Server cleanup and documentation updates
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Security audit and API documentation

### Available PlayFab APIs
- **Admin API**: 30+ endpoints for title management (secret key required)
- **Server API**: 15+ endpoints for server-authoritative operations (secret key required)
- **Client API**: 20+ endpoints for player operations (public access, used by React app)

**Result**: Pure static web app with PlayFab cloud backend - matches Unity implementation.  
**Next**: Implement CloudScript validation for production security.
