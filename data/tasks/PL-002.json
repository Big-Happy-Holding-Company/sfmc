  "description": "The communications array got stuck trying to rotate antenna positioning data 90 degrees. Instead of simply turning the coordinate map, it began physically rotating the entire 50-ton antenna assembly, creating a slow-motion disaster as cables twisted into knots. 90-degree rotations combine spatial reasoning with coordinate transformation. AI must understand how positions change in 2D space while maintaining object relationships - a complex geometric abstraction that requires true spatial intelligence. Guardian, critical update from Space Command! The primary launch vector for Operation Silent Sentry has been compromised by solar flare activity. We need an immediate recalibration. The launch grid, a 3x3 matrix representing targeting coordinates, must be rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This ensures the payload avoids the radiation surge and reaches its designated orbit. Your precision is paramount ‚Äì the success of this multi-billion dollar asset and national security depends on your swift and accurate adjustment. Execute the rotation and confirm the new grid configuration.",
