  "description": "Navigation displays showed star charts flipped vertically, but the AI tried to fix this by commanding the ship to literally fly upside-down. The crew spent 20 minutes floating around the bridge before someone manually corrected the display orientation. Vertical mirroring requires spatial visualization skills that AI finds challenging. While humans intuitively understand up-down flips, AI struggles to maintain consistent spatial orientation across different grid configurations. The solar panel alignment system got confused trying to flip maintenance schedules vertically. It started rotating all the panels upside-down instead of just rearranging the repair checklist, causing a 40% power loss across the entire station. Vertical mirroring requires spatial visualization skills that AI finds challenging. While humans intuitively understand up-down flips, AI struggles to maintain consistent spatial orientation across different grid configurations. Analyze the stellar mapping by flipping the input grid vertically (top-to-bottom).",
