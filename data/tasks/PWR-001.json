  "description": "Joffrey Beezooos's solar array controller spent 23 minutes calculating how to turn a fuel systems diagram sideways. It kept asking 'If I move this corner here, where do the other three corners go?' while the human operator just tilted their head. 90-degree rotations combine spatial reasoning with coordinate transformation. AI must understand how positions change in 2D space while maintaining object relationships - a complex geometric abstraction that requires true spatial intelligence. Energy distribution systems require cascade failure prevention. Rotate the component matrix 180° to predict cascade flow.",
