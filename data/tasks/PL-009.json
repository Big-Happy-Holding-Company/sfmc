  "description": "The waste management system tried to rotate disposal schedules by 270 degrees but applied three separate 90-degree transforms to the actual rotating waste compactor. The machine spun through three slow quarter-turns, taking 45 minutes to complete what should have been a 5-second data adjustment. 270-degree rotations are particularly challenging because they require understanding that three quarter-turns equal one three-quarter turn, not just applying 90-degree logic three times. This tests deeper spatial reasoning and transformation composition. Rotate the indicator grid 270° clockwise 🔁🔁🔁 (or 90° counter-clockwise 🔄) to match the final launch control orientation.",

    "This is like spinning a toy three times to the right instead of once to the left to end up in the same place. You know they're the same, but computers have to think step-by-step through each turn.",
    "Imagine you're playing 'Simon Says' and Simon says 'turn around 3/4 of the way.' You'd just turn almost all the way around and stop. But a computer might think it has to turn a little bit, then turn again, then turn again, taking much longer to get to the same place.",
    "It's like when you're unscrewing a jar lid. You know you need to turn it mostly around to the left, but a computer might think it needs to turn it a little to the right three times instead of just turning left once. Both ways work, but one is much sillier.",
    "Rotate the entire grid 270° clockwise 🔁🔁🔁 you can also think of this as one 90° counter-clockwise 🔄 rotation.",
    "Columns become rows from bottom to top.",
    "⬛ rotates like any other cell."
