  "description": "Airlock control systems got confused trying to rotate safety protocols 270 degrees. Instead of one smooth turn, it performed three separate 90-degree rotations of the actual airlock chamber, cycling through pressurization three times and trapping two astronauts in the middle. 270-degree rotations are particularly challenging because they require understanding that three quarter-turns equal one three-quarter turn, not just applying 90-degree logic three times. This tests deeper spatial reasoning and transformation composition. Analyze the environmental data by rotating the input grid 270 degrees clockwise 🔁🔁🔁.",
