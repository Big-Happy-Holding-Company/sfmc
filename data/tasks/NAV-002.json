  "description": "Joffrey Beezooos's solar array controller spent 23 minutes calculating how to turn a fuel systems diagram sideways. It kept asking 'If I move this corner here, where do the other three corners go?' while the human operator just tilted their head. 90-degree rotations combine spatial reasoning with coordinate transformation. AI must understand how positions change in 2D space while maintaining object relationships - a complex geometric abstraction that requires true spatial intelligence. Navigation arrays require 90 degree clockwise rotation for orbital alignment. Study the directional transformation patterns.",

    "When you turn a picture sideways, you just know what it looks like. But computers have to figure out where every single dot should move when you spin something. It's like doing a puzzle where every piece changes places.",
    "Think about when you turn your head to look at something sideways. You don't have to think about it - you just do it. But a computer is like someone who has to carefully move every toy in your room to new spots just to see what it looks like from a different angle.",
    "It's like playing with a kaleidoscope. When you turn it, all the pretty colors move to new places, but you can still see it's the same pattern. A computer would have to track where each tiny piece of color went and calculate its new home.",
    "Turn the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise (¼ turn to the right).",
    "The top row becomes the rightmost column, read top to bottom.",
    "Apply this rotation to the entire grid, including the black cells."
