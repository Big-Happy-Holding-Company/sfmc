  "description": "Elun Stink's life-support unit tried to flip the oxygen sensor readings upside-down by rotating the entire space station instead of just the data display. Mission Control had to remind them that 'up' and 'down' are relative to the grid, not gravity. Vertical mirroring requires spatial visualization skills that AI finds challenging. While humans intuitively understand up-down flips, AI struggles to maintain consistent spatial orientation across different grid configurations. Analyze the course plotting by flipping the input grid vertically (top-to-bottom).",
