  "description": "Medical bay scanners couldn't figure out how to rotate X-ray images 90 degrees for proper viewing. The AI kept trying to physically rotate the injured astronaut on the examination table instead of just turning the digital image on the screen. 90-degree rotations combine spatial reasoning with coordinate transformation. AI must understand how positions change in 2D space while maintaining object relationships - a complex geometric abstraction that requires true spatial intelligence. Rotate trajectory control grid 90¬∞ clockwise üîÅ to align with updated launch vector.",
