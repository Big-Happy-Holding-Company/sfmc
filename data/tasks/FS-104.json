  "description": "The communications array got stuck trying to rotate antenna positioning data 90 degrees. Instead of simply turning the coordinate map, it began physically rotating the entire 50-ton antenna assembly, creating a slow-motion disaster as cables twisted into knots. 90-degree rotations combine spatial reasoning with coordinate transformation. AI must understand how positions change in 2D space while maintaining object relationships - a complex geometric abstraction that requires true spatial intelligence. Analyze the flow regulation by rotating the input grid 90 degrees clockwise üîÅ.",
