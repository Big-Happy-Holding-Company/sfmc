  "description": "The waste management system tried to rotate disposal schedules by 270 degrees but applied three separate 90-degree transforms to the actual rotating waste compactor. The machine spun through three slow quarter-turns, taking 45 minutes to complete what should have been a 5-second data adjustment. 270-degree rotations are particularly challenging because they require understanding that three quarter-turns equal one three-quarter turn, not just applying 90-degree logic three times. This tests deeper spatial reasoning and transformation composition. Analyze the defense matrix by rotating the input grid 270 degrees clockwise 🔁🔁🔁.",
