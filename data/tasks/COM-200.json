  "description": "The Tesla Corporation's quantum nav computer kept trying to calculate mirror reflections by asking 'Which pixel goes where?' for every single cell. It processed 847 calculations just to flip a 2x2 grid, while Rick the Intern figured it out by glancing at it. AI struggles with spatial reasoning and mirror symmetry because it processes data sequentially rather than understanding 2D spatial relationships. Unlike humans who instantly recognize left-right flips, AI must learn complex coordinate transformations. The AI kept trying to calculate mirror reflections pixel by pixel. AI struggles with spatial reasoning and mirror symmetry. Analyze the broadcast patterns by reflecting the input grid horizontally (left-to-right mirror).",
