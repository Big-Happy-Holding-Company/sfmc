  "description": "The solar panel alignment system got confused trying to flip maintenance schedules vertically. It started rotating all the panels upside-down instead of just rearranging the repair checklist, causing a 40% power loss across the entire station. Vertical mirroring requires spatial visualization skills that AI finds challenging. While humans intuitively understand up-down flips, AI struggles to maintain consistent spatial orientation across different grid configurations. Analyze the course plotting by flipping the input grid vertically (top-to-bottom).",
