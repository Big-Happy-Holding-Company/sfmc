    "Space Force Protocol: Antenna array synchronization requires diagonal transformation and component replacement to establish optimal signal coherence patterns.",
    "Phase 1 - Array Reorientation: Apply secondary diagonal reflection to transpose the antenna matrix. Element at position (row,col) moves to position (gridSize-1-col, gridSize-1-row).",
    "Phase 2 - Component Replacement: Replace all inactive components (value 0) with value 7 to represent upgraded signal amplifiers and active transmission nodes.",
    "Technical Implementation: First reflect along secondary diagonal (anti-diagonal), then replace all 0 values with 7 for full system activation.",
    "Validation Check: Verify the grid has been transformed along the secondary diagonal and all positions show active components (no zeros remain).",
    "Created by: Cascade with Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking. Design rationale: Combines Secondary Diagonal Reflection with Value Replacement to simulate antenna array synchronization requiring both geometric transformation and component upgrade protocols."
