    "First, reflect across primary diagonal: [i][j] becomes [j][i]. This transforms rows into columns.",
    "Then increment all non-zero values by 2, using modulo 10 for overflow (8→0, 9→1).",
    "Satellite imagery systems require diagonal flip for north-up vs south-up orientation processing.",
    "The calibration offset (increment by 2) compensates for sensor drift in different orientations.",
    "This combination tests both spatial transformation recognition and arithmetic sequence patterns.",
    "Created by: Cascade with Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking based on types.md. Combined Primary Diagonal Reflection (#6) with Sequence Increment (#14) to create a realistic satellite calibration scenario that tests geometric transformation followed by systematic value adjustment, simulating how real satellite sensors need both orientation correction and calibration offsets."
