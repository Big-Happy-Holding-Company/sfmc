    "First, reflect across secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): [i][j] becomes [n-1-j][n-1-i].",
    "Then apply OR operation: output[i][j] = original[i][j] OR reflected[i][j]. Non-zero values from either position remain.",
    "Thruster arrays need redundant signal paths - if either original or mirrored thruster fires, the position stays active.",
    "Secondary diagonal reflection simulates thruster layout symmetry for spacecraft stability control.",
    "OR logic ensures backup systems activate when primary OR secondary thrusters engage.",
    "Created by: Cascade with Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking based on types.md. Combined Secondary Diagonal Reflection (#7) with OR Operation (#22) to simulate thruster redundancy systems where symmetric thruster pairs provide backup coverage through logical union operations, testing both geometric mirror recognition and binary logical reasoning."
